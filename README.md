# udacity_musical_app_design
This app is to describe the functionality of a music playing app.

As a part of Udacity Nanodegree this app is created for practicing the design analysis of Android apps.

This practice app helped to learn the following:
1) Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
2) Creating new activities
3) Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app.
4) Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
